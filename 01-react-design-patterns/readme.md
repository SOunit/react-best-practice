# react problem

- state control with large scale system
- Poor maintainability due to lack of view/state separation
- Scope of state cannot be limited

# redux solution

- flux(one direction state flow architecture)

# flux

## flex

- Flux is an architectural pattern introduced by “Facebook” to work with React. It is a slight modification of the observer-observable pattern and it is not a library or a framework. The main feature in Flux is the concept of uni-directional data flow.

## redux

- Redux is a library inspired by Flux and can be considered as an implementation of Flux. Redux makes easy to handle the state of the application and manage to display data on user actions. It is a very powerful library but also very lightweight.
